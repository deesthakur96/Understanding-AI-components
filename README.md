## Understanding-AI-components

**Repository:** deesthakur96/Understanding-AI-components
**License:** GPL-3.0 ([GitHub][1])
**Description:**
A curated set of tutorials and reference materials that detail the **full stack of Artificial Intelligence systems** — from hardware to models to middleware to applications. The goal is to demystify how AI works in practice by breaking down key components, open-source tools, real-world boards, and software frameworks.

### What’s Inside

* **Hardware guides**: Overview of AI-accelerator types (GPUs, TPUs, NPUs, FPGAs) and edge boards (e.g., Jetson, Coral, Khadas)
* **Middleware breakdowns**: Explains vector databases, retrieval‐augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, orchestration frameworks, observability & governance
* **Software stack & application layer**: The architectures that deliver AI value — agents, copilots, workflows, user-facing intelligence
* **Open-source links and resources**: Consolidated lists of repositories and boards so readers can explore the ecosystems themselves

### Why This Repository Exists

As AI technologies advance rapidly, most practitioners focus on **models only**. This repository argues that real differentiation lies in mastering the **entire stack**:
**Hardware → Models → Middleware → Applications.**
By offering structured tutorials across these layers, the project aims to help learners, developers, and architects build a **holistic understanding** of production-grade AI systems.

### Who Should Use It

* AI engineers looking to go beyond model development
* Systems architects designing AI infrastructures
* Students and self-learners exploring the full AI stack
* Technology leaders evaluating how to align compute, data, and application layers

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deesthakur96/Understanding-AI-components.git  
   ```
2. Explore the root folders: hardware, middleware, stack guides.
3. Review the tutorials and reference PDFs included (e.g., *Understanding_AI_Hardware_With_Open_Source.pdf*, *Understanding_AI_Middleware_With_Open_Source.pdf*) ([GitHub][1])
4. Dive into the open-source links provided to explore actual projects and boards.
